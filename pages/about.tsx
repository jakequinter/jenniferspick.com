        Hello üëãüèª , I'm Jennifer Spick. I am currently involved in a variety of
        things that intrigue me.

      <p className="pb-2">
        Right now I am the Medical Billing Specialist and Receptionist at{' '}
        <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://www.motionworkspt.com/">

        patient care.

        I am also the Lead Pharmacy Technician at{' '}
        <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://www.cvs.com/">

        </a>
        , where I get to assist in the training and development of new hires.
        This company holds a special place in my heart, as it is where I spent
        the majority of my undergraduate degree working.
      </p>
