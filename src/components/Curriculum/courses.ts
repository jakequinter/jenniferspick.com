      'This class helped me grasp a better understanding of rural healthcare and the many social determinants of health and health disparities. Being able to understand and identify social determinants and health disparities is what makes exceptional healthcare professionals. ',

    description:
      'Our future is in the hands of technology and being able to learn and advance in this area is critical. This curriculum taught me a lot of useful information, specifically working with Excel. I found this course challenging due to the multiple steps and “shortcuts” if you will, that it takes to learn and memorize to develop graphs and information. These concepts are something I will definitely need further education and training on but I do think that this is something I can become more fluent in with more repetition.',

    description:
      'This is one of the courses I found very applicable and relevant. I think it’s so important for organizations to reciprocate appreciation to their employees, who create profit for the organization. Leveraging human capital is a requirement to sustain a competitive advantage, retain talent, and satisfy your workers. Organizations cannot perform to their highest potential without employees who feel appreciated, understood, and valued by their employers. This course has helped me recognize how employers take the initiative to implement human capital measures, or their lack thereof.',

    description:
      'One key takeaway from this course was the use and implementation of a project charter. I’ve grown familiar with the benefits of a project charter and its purpose in operations and project management. Managing the scope of a project, whether it’s for process improvement, coordinating care, managing inventory, addressing capacity, etc. can be complex and challenging. There are many processes to consider when analyzing healthcare operations which is why it takes strong project management skills to deliver successful results.',

Prior to this course, I was aware of methods such as SWOT and Forcefield analyses, however I was not aware of the dozens of problem-solving tools that exist and their relevance to process improvement. I think what I have yet to learn, and experience is how/when to apply each problem-solving technique.',

Being able to recognize and understand what’s evolving in healthcare and how we must act to implement change is a very important part of our role. This course specifically taught me more about cultural competence in healthcare and what it means to be a culturally competent healthcare leader. Our country is more diverse now than it’s ever been while continuing to become more diverse, and we cannot provide patients with the utmost quality of care if we are not culturally competent. ',
